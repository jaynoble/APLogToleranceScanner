# APLogToleranceScanner
Cobb AccessPort data log tolerance scanner allows users to enter in a data log csv file generated by their Cobb AccessPort and identify any monitor values that are outside of a given tolerance range.
Sure, this could be done in Excel but this is a fun way to learn Java and make something useful that can ultimately scan all data logs and flag any abnormalities.
